<h3>This wine costs 75.0 $ and it is produced at Prêt a Boire. 
Here is what you should know about it: A blend of Syrah and Grenache, this may be the most expensive rosé in California. It&#39;s a good wine, dry and crisp, although rather full-bodied for a rosé, with pleasantly complex orange zest, strawberry, vanilla, herb and spice flavors. Nice now with cured meats and sausages, or a rich fish stew. </h3>
