<h1>Corallina</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 25.0 $ and it is produced at Cornerstone. 
Here is what you should know about it: Made from Syrah grapes with purpose, not as a saign√©e, this is an alluring wine, its aromatics exuberant in wild strawberry and rhubarb, with a pithy, textured vibe. With just the right amount of power and body, it&#39;s vibrant and yet has body and weight, retaining substance through the long finish. </h3>
