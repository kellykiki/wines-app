<h1>Rosato</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 21.0 $ and it is produced at Swanson. 
Here is what you should know about it: A perfect summer blush wine. Made in the style of the southern Rh√¥ne, it&#39;s rich in strawberry, raspberry, rosehip tea, vanilla and spice flavors, brightened with zesty acidity. Just delicious with smoked meats, tempura, ahi tuna tartare. </h3>
