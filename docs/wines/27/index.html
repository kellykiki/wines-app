<h1>Rosato</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 16.0 $ and it is produced at Benessere. 
Here is what you should know about it: This is a simple, sweet blush wine, with jammy raspberry, vanilla and white sugar flavors. With nice acidity, it will wash down salty, umami-flavored foods, like ham, sausages, roasted nuts, olives. </h3>
