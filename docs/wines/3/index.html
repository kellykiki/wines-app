<h1>Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 14.0 $ and it is produced at Vinum. 
Here is what you should know about it: Cabernet Sauvignon may be the hardest variety to make a rosé from because it yields such a big wine. Vinum tries their best, but despite good fruit and acidity, the wine is heavy, lacking the racy vivacity a great blush wine should have. </h3>
