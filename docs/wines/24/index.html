<h3>This wine costs 24.0 $ and it is produced at Virage. 
Here is what you should know about it: This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you&#39;d expect, it&#39;s a big wine for a ros√©, a little heavy, but there&#39;s a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry? Sort of, with a jammy finish of black raspberries. Try this easy-drinking wine with grilled tuna or a hamburger. </h3>
