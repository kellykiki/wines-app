<h3>This wine costs 13.0 $ and it is produced at Hendry. 
Here is what you should know about it: Hendry has been doing interesting things in lesser-known niches, including rosé, and this one, an unusual blend of all five Bordeaux red varieties plus Primitivo, is worth considering. It&#39;s nicely dry and crisp, with flavors of cherries, tobacco, herbs, flowers and vanilla. Very Provençal. </h3>
