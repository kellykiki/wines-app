<h1>Rose of Merlot</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 19.0 $ and it is produced at Rutherford Hill. 
Here is what you should know about it: A little simple and easy, but there&#39;s a wealth of raspberry, strawberry and floral notes in this delicate wine. It&#39;s a bit too sweet for my tastes, although it does have good acidity. </h3>
