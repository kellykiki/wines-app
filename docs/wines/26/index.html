<h1>Alma&#39;s Napa</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 21.0 $ and it is produced at Tudal. 
Here is what you should know about it: Made from Zinfandel, Malbec, Sangiovese and Pinot Noir, this tastes rich in cranberries, watermelons and strawberries. The acidity is refreshingly tart, but the ripe fruit flavors make it somewhat cloying on the palate. </h3>
