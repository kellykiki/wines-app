<h3>This wine costs 22.0 $ and it is produced at Kale. 
Here is what you should know about it: Made from a blend of 62% Grenache and 38% Syrah, this is a classically dry, refreshingly crisp ros√©, pink-salmon in color that&#39;s intense yet soft, crafted in a Provence style. The grapes come from Rutherford, Atlas Peak and Sonoma County&#39;s Kick Ranch, tasting of fresh raspberry and spring flowers, a bite of wet stone on the finish. </h3>
