<h1>Lot #3</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 13.0 $ and it is produced at Tangley Oaks. 
Here is what you should know about it: The label doesn&#39;t tell us what the grapes in the blend are, but it doesn&#39;t really matter, because this ros√© is pretty ordinary. It&#39;s dark and heavy and syrupy, with candied flavors of raspberries and vanilla. </h3>
