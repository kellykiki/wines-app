<h3>This wine costs 30.0 $ and it is produced at Terra Valentine. 
Here is what you should know about it: This darker-salmon-colored ros√© combines Sangiovese and Pinot Noir in equal proportion. It delivers faint aromatics of nectarine and rustic cherry, the color reflecting the burly properties of Napa Valley Sangiovese. Dry, with racy acidity, it has grip on the finish. </h3>
