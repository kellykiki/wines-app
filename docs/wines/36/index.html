<h1>Deep Rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 20.0 $ and it is produced at Isabel Mondavi. 
Here is what you should know about it: To call this rosé deep is an understatement. In color and body, it&#39;s almost a red wine. But it does have the silky delicacy of a blush wine, and is frankly delicious in cherry jam, red licorice and Dr. Pepper flavors. It finishes thoroughly dry, and the acidity is racy. </h3>
