<h1>Ros√© of Syrah</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 25.0 $ and it is produced at Peju. 
Here is what you should know about it: With a dark color and full body, this isn&#39;t very subtle. It&#39;s almost a red wine in itself, shows raspberry, strawberry and vanilla flavors that are sweet on the finish. </h3>
