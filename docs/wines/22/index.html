<h1>La Grenouille Rougant√© Pink Vin</h1>
<h3>This wine costs 12.0 $ and it is produced at Frog&#39;s Leap. 
Here is what you should know about it: There&#39;s lots of stimulating acidity in this wine, which is mostly from the Valdiguie grape, otherwise known as Napa Gamay. It shows good cherry and spice flavors and is on the dry side, making it a good palate cleaner. Great with sushi. </h3>
